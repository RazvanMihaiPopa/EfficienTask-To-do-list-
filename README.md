<!-- Refreshing page with a completed task -->

Unfortunately, if you marked a task as done and you refresh the page, it will be unmarked now. But keep in mind that you can also delete the task after you completed it!


<!-- Usage -->
## :eyes: Usage

Do any of the following seem familiar?

* You often feel completely overwhelmed with the amount of work you’ve got to do?
* You sometimes forget to do things that are important
* People have to chase you to get things done
* You find it a struggle to keep to deadlines
* Don’t think you’re unusual because there are thousands of people who struggle with the same every day, not just in the workplace but in their personal life too. 

Luckily, here comes my project!
One of the most significant benefits of why to do list is important that it will help you stay organized. It will also help those tasks appear more manageable.

You’ll be able to stay more focused because you’ve got an outline of what you’ve got to do and things you’ve already completed. Having tasks written in a list frees up space in your mind and allows you to be more creative.

Planning all the activities that you have to tackle then handling them in order can save you a lot of time and stress while focusing on priorities. To-do lists are some of the simplest productivity tools.

However, you have to use them correctly to enjoy any real benefits. A hurriedly made checklist can end up wasting your day rather than organising it.
